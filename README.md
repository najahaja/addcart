# Food Ordering Add to Cart

This repository contains a project showcasing an **Add to Cart functionality** for a food ordering application, built with React. As a beginner, this project was both a challenge and a learning experience. It took me around 10 hours to complete, and I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished.

## Key Features

- **React's Context API:** Used for state management to avoid prop drilling.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Each page is built as a separate component, ensuring modularity and reusability.
- **Dynamic Data Handling:** JSON data is used to populate the application dynamically.

## What I Learned

- Efficient state management with React's Context API.
- Creating and organizing components for better modularity.
- Handling JSON data and integrating it into a React application.
